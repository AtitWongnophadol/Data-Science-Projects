    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: The text content is very sparse with over 26 thousands features in each example, in which most features are 0, making it very difficult for the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to identify the correct label. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: According to this study (http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-discriminativegenerative.pdf), logistic regression performs better than Naive Bayes model, when the training size is infinite. However, in this training example that we have, the training size (2,304) is relatively small compared to the number of features (26,879), which in general helps improve the results for Naive Bayes (ref: http://dataespresso.com/en/2017/10/24/comparison-between-naive-bayes-and-logistic-regression/). For logistic regression, when we have a small training size like this, the regularization parameter like Lasso (L1) or Ridge (L2) can help adjust the fitting and results of the model; increasing it makes the model more parsimonious (more generalized).\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001)."

    "(i) While CountVectorizer counts the frequency of the word occurences, TfidVectorizer further normalizes vocaularies and takes into account the frequency of the word occurence by by applying an \"inverse document frequency\" that lessens the importance of words such as \"the\" that frequently occurs but add less to the meaning of the content.\n",

    "In the first two examples, the model predict the content to be of religious topic, when they are actually labeld \"sci.space\".
